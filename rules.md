# X-Team 30 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will assign tasks based on initial interest and self-described capabilities, and we can 
reassign tasks if any member decides that a different task would be more apt for their work.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will communicate with email and discord about the progress of task completion, and we 
can also keep an eye on the github repository to make sure that things are being updated 
adequately. Follow up can be done if tasks are deemed necessary to be reevaluated. 


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will openly discuss any difficulties we come across on discord, and brainstorm different ways 
of overcoming that difficulty and share resources that may help. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
All members must attend team meetings, and complete assigned parts of the assignment. If members have
difficulties completing the assignment by the deadline, they must notify the rest of the team.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
